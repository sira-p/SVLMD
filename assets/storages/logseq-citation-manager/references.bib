  abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a state of brain dysfunction resulting from decompensation of cirrhosis. The mortality and morbidity associated with the overt form of hepatic encephalopathy are high, and even the covert form associates with poor outcomes and poor quality of life. We know that the dysfunction is not just an acute insult to the brain but rather results in long-standing cognitive issues that get worse with each episode of HE. Hence, there is an urgency to accurately diagnose these conditions, start appropriate therapy, and to maintain remission. Currently, we have two mainstay pharmacological treatment options (lactulose and rifaximin), but the narrative is evolving with new therapies under trial. Microbiome manipulation resulting in a favorable change to the gut microbiota seems to be a promising new area of therapy.},

  abstract = {Colon cancer is a common preventable cancer. With the adoption of widespread colon cancer screening in the developed countries, the incidence and mortality of colon cancer have decreased in the targeted population. But unfortunately, the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been increasing over the last 25 years in the young adults below the age of 50. There is disparity in benefit, i.e. reduction in risk of death between right-sided and left-sided colon cancer by screening colonoscopy. The reason could be multifactorial and various measures have been taken to decrease this disparity. Although most of the screened populations are average risk individuals, a minority of the population have various risk factors for developing colon cancer and need to follow specific colon cancer screening guidelines. Gene mutations (adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), deleted in colon cancer (DCC), K-ras, p53, B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), mismatch repair genes) and microsatellite instability lead to the development of colon cancer. Although various non-invasive methods of colon cancer screening are now available, colonoscopy remains the gold standard of colon cancer screening and adenoma detection rate is now being used as the quality metrics in screening colonoscopy. Although Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) and American College of Physicians (ACP) recommend initiating screening colonoscopy at age 50 years in all individuals except African Americans who should begin screening colonoscopy at age 45 years, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends initiating screening colonoscopy at age 45 years in all individuals irrespective of race and ethnicity. Low-volume split-dose prep has been found to be as effective as high-volume split-dose prep and more tolerable to patients with increased compliance. Boston bowel preparation scale is recommended to measure the quality of colon cleansing. CRC is curative if it is diagnosed at an early stage but various palliative treatment options (endoscopic, oncologic and surgical) are available in advanced stages of this cancer. Adequate number of lymph node assessment during surgery is essential in accurate staging of CRC. Checkpoint inhibitors have been found to have dramatic response and durable clinical benefit in dMMR/MSI-H metastatic CRC. Different genetic and immune-oncologic research trials are ongoing for early detection and better management of CRC.},

  abstract = {Background: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a widely used treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), combining targeted chemotherapy and embolization. While effective, TACE can be associated with significant gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, impacting a patient’s quality of life. Objectives: Quantify the prevalence of key GI complications (diarrhea, nausea, GI toxicity, abdominal pain) following TACE. Design: Systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, focusing on studies that reported side effects of TACE. Studies not involving cTACE or drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE), non-HCC studies, meta-analyses or systematic reviews, and inaccessible publications were excluded. Data sources and methods: A PubMed search for clinical and randomized trials was conducted. Extracted data included study identifiers, demographics, TACE details, and GI side effect prevalences. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool assessed study quality and bias. Results: The analysis included data from 81 studies with 121 individual study arms and 9495 patients. Diarrhea was reported in 38 studies, with a mean prevalence of 23.46\% (2.5; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 18.39–28.544) and a weighted prevalence of 23.5\%. Nausea was most frequently reported, mentioned in 67 studies, with a mean prevalence of 34.66\% (2.4; 95\% CI: 29.89–39.44) and a weighted prevalence of 32.5\%. Abdominal pain was reported in 59 studies, with the highest mean prevalence of 48.07\% (2.9; 95\% CI: 42.20–53.93) and a weighted prevalence of 46.1\%. GI toxicity was reported in 32 studies, with a mean prevalence of 8.85\% (1.4; 95\% CI: 5.99–11.70) and a weighted prevalence of 9.9\%. DEB-TACE generally led to slightly higher rates of nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and GI toxicity compared to conventional TACE. The type of chemotherapy agent influenced prevalence of GI-side effects, with high prevalences observed for agents such as zinostatin and cisplatin. Conclusion: This meta-analysis synthesizes current evidence on managing GI side effects in TACE. Standardizing reporting and developing effective management strategies are crucial to improving patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {The main causes of acute pancreatitis (AP) are biliary disease, alcohol consumption, hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of these aetiological factors on the severity and outcome of AP. Pubmed and Embase were searched between 01/01/2012 and 31/05/2020. Included articles involved adult alcoholic, biliary, HTG- or post-ERCP AP (PAP) patients. Primary outcome was severity, secondary outcomes were organ failures, intensive care unit admission, recurrence rate, pancreatic necrosis, mortality, length of hospital stay, pseudocyst, fluid collection and systematic inflammatory response syndrome. Data were analysed from 127 eligible studies. The risk for non-mild (moderately severe and severe) condition was the highest in HTG-induced AP (HTG-AP) followed by alcoholic AP (AAP), biliary AP (BAP) and PAP. Recurrence rate was significantly lower among BAP vs. HTG-AP or AAP patients (OR\,=\,2.69 and 2.98, 95\% CI 1.55–4.65 and 2.22–4.01, respectively). Mortality rate was significantly greater in HTG-AP vs. AAP or BAP (OR\,=\,1.72 and 1.50, 95\% CI 1.04–2.84 and 0.96–2.35, respectively), pancreatic necrosis occurred more frequently in AAP than BAP patients (OR\,=\,1.58, 95\% CI 1.08–2.30). Overall, there is a potential association between aetiology and the development and course of AP. HTG-AP is associated with the highest number of complications. Furthermore, AAP is likely to be more severe than BAP or PAP. Greater emphasis should be placed on determining aetiology on admission.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the current research was to reevaluate the normative data on the eyeball diameters.  Methods. In a prospective cohort study, the CT data of consecutive 250 adults with healthy eyes were collected and analyzed, and sagittal, transverse, and axial diameters of both eyeballs were measured. The data obtained from the left eye and from the right eye were compared. The correlation analysis was performed with the following variables: orbit size, gender, age, and ethnic background. Results. We did not find statistically significant differences correlated with gender of the patients and their age. The right eyeball was slightly smaller than the left one but this difference was statistically insignificant (P = 0.17). We did not find statistically significant differences of the eyeball sizes among the ethnicities we dealt with. Strong correlation was found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit (r = 0.88). Conclusion. The size of a human adult eye is approximately 24.2\,mm\,(transverse)\,×\,23.7\,mm\,(sagittal)\,×\,22.0–24.8\,mm (axial) with no significant difference between sexes and age groups. In the transverse diameter, the eyeball size may vary from 21\,mm to 27\,mm. These data might be useful in ophthalmological, oculoplastic, and neurological practice.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy and fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent advances in systemic and locoregional therapies have led to changes in many guidelines regarding systemic therapy, as well as the possibility to downstage patients to undergo resection. This review examines the advances in surgical and medical therapies relative to multidisciplinary treatment strategies for HCC.HCC is a major health problem worldwide. The obesity epidemic has made nonalcoholic fatty liver disease a major risk factor for the development of HCC. Multiple societies, such as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the European Association for the Study of the Liver, the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, provide guidelines for screening at-risk patients, as well as define staging systems to guide optimal treatment strategies. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system is widely accepted and has recently undergone updates with the introduction of new systemic therapies and stage migration.The treatment of patients with HCC should involve a multidisciplinary approach with collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and interventional radiologists to provide optimal care. Treatment paradigms must consider both tumor and patient-related factors such as extent of liver disease, which is a main driver of morbidity and mortality. The advent of more effective systemic and locoregional therapies has prolonged survival among patients with advanced disease and allowed some patients to undergo surgical intervention who would otherwise have disease considered unresectable.},

The incidence of HCC is on the rise in Thailand, where it has become the most common malignancy in males and the third most common in females. Here, we review some of the risk factors that have contributed to this increase in HCC incidence in the Thai population. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the main etiologic risk factor for HCC, followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with HBV genotype C have a higher positive rate of hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg) and progress to cirrhosis and HCC earlier than genotype B. For HCV patients, 16\% developed HCC associated cirrhosis by year 5 after diagnosis, and the cumulative risk for death from HCC at year 10 was 60\%. Dietary exposure to the fungal hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 has been shown to interact synergistically with HBV infection to increase the risk of early onset HCC. Chronic alcohol abuse remains an important risk factor for malignant transformation of hepatocytes, frequently in association with alcohol-induced cirrhosis. In recent years, obesity and metabolic syndrome have markedly increased the incidence of HCC and are important causes of HCC in some resource-rich regions.},

The study was conducted in 11 Thai provincial hospitals. The hospitals in this study were selected by stratification by regions. Patients included 504 ones who were newly diagnosed with colon cancer within 1 month. In the control group, 997 health individuals were enrolled. Both case and control were adjusted by age. The results of this study showed that age and socioeconomic factors were associated with colon cancer risk. In addition, it was found that family history of colon cancer had very high association with colon cancer risk. Behavioral factors, including smoking, inadequate physical exercise, and salty food consumption were associated with colon cancer. We detected no association between obesity, alcohol consumption, and colon cancer. The results suggested that colon cancer might have higher association with genetic factors than behavioral factors among Thai patients. Based on the results of this study, stop smoking and promote adequate physical activity are suggested to reduce the incidence of colon cancrr among Thai patients.},

  abstract = {Background Common bile duct (CBD) stones may be over looked at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), particularly when intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) is not performed. Currently, there is no data available about the time course and pattern of presentation for stones retained in the CBD at the time of LC. The aim of this study was to establish the time course and pattern of presentation of unsuspected retained CBD stones post LC. Methods Patients presenting with symptomatic CBD stones from 1994 until 2010, having previously undergone LC were studied in this retrospective, case note review. CBD stones were confirmed at ERCP. Data collected included LC date, mode of presentation, imaging results including CBD diameter, stone appearance, length of stay and post ERCP complications. Patients having an ERCP for stones found on IOC at LC were excluded. Results Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common mode of presentation was abdominal pain (n = 38, 62 \%) with (17) or without (21) deranged liver function tests. Nineteen (31 \%) patients presented with clinical complications of the CBD stones: cholangitis (10), acute biliary pancreatitis (6) or obstructive jaundice (3). The CBD was usually mild-to-moderately dilated (8–15 mm) on ultrasound. The median time span from LC to presentation with CBD stones was 4 years (range: 6 days–18 years). Five (8.2 \%) patients had a complication from their ERCP; mild pancreatitis (3), bleed (1) and cholangitis (1). Nineteen (31.1 \%) patients required more than one ERCP to complete stone/stent removal. Conclusions The median time for patients to present with symptomatic CBD stones after LC is 4 years. Patients with retrained stones may remain asymptomatic for many years. A third of the patients presented with potentially serious complications of the retained CBD stone. Future studies for CBD stones after LC need to follow patients for at least 10 years.},

  abstract = {Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant colorectal cancer syndrome, caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, on chromosome 5q21. It is characterized by hundreds of adenomatous colorectal polyps, with an almost inevitable progression to colorectal cancer at an average age of 35 to 40 yr. Associated features include upper gastrointestinal tract polyps, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, desmoid tumors, and other extracolonic malignancies. Gardner syndrome is more of a historical subdivision of FAP, characterized by osteomas, dental anomalies, epidermal cysts, and soft tissue tumors. Other specified variants include Turcot syndrome (associated with central nervous system malignancies) and hereditary desmoid disease. Several genotype–phenotype correlations have been observed. Attenuated FAP is a phenotypically distinct entity, presenting with fewer than 100 adenomas. Multiple colorectal adenomas can also be caused by mutations in the human MutY homologue (MYH) gene, in an autosomal recessive condition referred to as MYH associated polyposis (MAP). Endoscopic screening of FAP probands and relatives is advocated as early as the ages of 10–12 yr, with the objective of reducing the occurrence of colorectal cancer. Colectomy remains the optimal prophylactic treatment, while the choice of procedure (subtotal vs proctocolectomy) is still controversial. Along with identifying better chemopreventive agents, optimizing screening of extracolonic cancers and applying new radiological and endoscopic technology to the diagnosis and management of extracolonic features are the major challenges for the future.},

Approximately 5\% to 10\% of patients with acute cholecystitis have\mkbibemph{acalculous cholecystitis}, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81\% and a specificity of approximately 83\% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1-3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8\% for early vs 34.4\% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6\% for early vs 18.4\% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2\%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3\%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65\%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12\%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions and Relevance{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually.

  abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis and/or porto-systemic shunting. The clinical symptoms are widely variable, extending from subtle impairment in mental state to coma. The utility of categorizing the severity of HE accurately and efficiently serves not only to provide practical functional information about the current clinical status of the patient but also gives valuable prognostic information. In the past 20–30~years, there has been rapid progress in understanding the pathophysiological basis of HE; however, the lack of direct correlation between pathogenic factors and the severity of HE make it difficult to select appropriate therapy for HE patients. In this review, we will discuss the classification system and its limitations, the neuropsychometric assessments and their challenges, as well as the present knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms. Despite the many prevalent hypotheses around the pathogenesis of the disease, most treatments focus on targeting and lowering the accumulation of ammonia as well as inflammation. However, treatment of minimal HE remains a huge unmet need and a big concerted effort is needed to better define this condition to allow the development of new therapies. We review the currently available therapies and future approaches to treat HE as well as the scientific and clinical data that support their effectiveness.},

The most common cause of obstruction is stones, but other causes include strictures, which form after surgery or endoscopy or which may be secondary to sclerosing cholangitis; cysts; diverticula; congenital abnormalities; choledochoceles; pancreatitis; pancreatic or choledochal neoplasms; parasites (Ascaris, Clonorchis, or Echinococcus spp.); blockage in a drainage tube; or extrinsic compression.* *References 3, 20, 61, 86, 87, 96, 99, 101, 107, 125, 151, 176, 177, 180, 181, 195, 197, 198, 201, 202, 210, 244, 250, 255 The obstruction is usually complete, and, as a result, the infected material is unable to drain adequately.

It started suddenly yesterday evening and lasted for a few hours, but then it came on again in the morning. She says it feels like a tight band around her upper abdomen. She had a similar, less painful, episode a few weeks ago which resolved with over-the-counter analgesia. She is otherwise healthy and has intentionally lost 5\,kg in the past six weeks.  This article outlines how to assess and manage a patient with suspected biliary colic in primary care. Areas covered include criteria for referral, investigations, and discussion of management options. Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with many causes, as outlined in box 1. Gallstone pathology is an important differential. Box 2 describes the spectrum of clinical syndromes that can arise from gallstones.

Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model and the Poisson log-linear model were used to examine the incidence rates of colon cancer standardized by national references; from the database of the National Health Security Office, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand and NASA’s database from aerosol diagnostics model. Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) was used to explore disease-gender-specific spatio-temporal patterns of colon cancer incidences and accumulated air pollution-related cancers in Thailand between 2010 and 2016. A total of 59,605 patients were selected for the study. Due to concerns regarding statistical reliability between aerosol diagnostics model and colon cancer incidences, the posterior probabilities of risk appeared the most in dust PM               2.5               . It could be interpreted as relative risk in every increase of 10~μg/m               3               in black carbon, organic carbon, and dust-PM               2.5               levels were associated respectively with an increase of 4\%, 4\%, and 15\% in the risks of colon cancer. A significant increase in the incidence of colon cancer with accumulated ambient air quality raised concerns regarding the prevention of air pollution. This study utilized data based on the incidences of colon cancer; the country’s database and linked cancer data to pollution. According to the database from NASA’s technology, this research has never been conducted in Thailand.},

  abstract = {Retinal detachment (RD) occurs when the neurosensory retina, the neurovascular tissue responsible for phototransduction, is separated from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Given the importance of the RPE for optimal retinal function, RD invariably leads to decreased vision. There are three main types of RD: rhegmatogenous, tractional and exudative (also termed serous) RD. In rhegmatogenous RD, one or more retinal breaks enable vitreous fluid to enter the subretinal space and separate the neurosensory retina from the RPE. In tractional RD, preretinal, intraretinal or subretinal membranes contract and exert tangential forces and elevate the retina from the underlying RPE. Finally, in exudative RD, an underlying inflammatory condition, vascular abnormality or the presence of a tumour causes exudative fluid to accumulate in the subretinal space, exceeding the osmotic pump function of the RPE. The surgical management of RD usually involves pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling or pneumatic retinopexy. The approach taken often depends on patient characteristics as well as on practitioner experience and clinical judgement. Advances in surgical technology and continued innovation have improved outcomes for many patients. However, even if retinal re-attachment is achieved, some patients still experience decreased vision or other visual symptoms, such as metamorphopsia, that diminish their quality of life. Continued research in the areas of neuroprotection and retinal biology as well as continued surgical innovation are necessary to enhance therapeutic options and outcomes for these patients.},

An operation is usually indicated in symptomatic high-grade and/or complicated hemorrhoids. Whilst hemorrhoidectomy has been the mainstay of surgical treatment, more recently other approaches have been employed including Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy, and doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation. Post-procedural pain and disease recurrence remain the most challenging problems in the treatment of hemorrhoids.

We analyzed 56 sets of common bile duct gallstones collected over a 10-yr period using infrared and atomic absorption spectroscopy and chemical methods. Twenty-four sets (43\%) of stones were cholesterol stones containing 85.3\% cholesterol, 3.2\% pigment, 0.6\% phosphate, and 1.3\% total calcium. Ten sets (18\%) were black pigment stones containing 36.5\% pigment, 11.4\% cholesterol, 7.6\% carbonate, 3.0\% phosphate, and 6.2\% total calcium. Twenty-two sets (39\%) were brown pigment stones containing 52.7\% pigment, 16.5\% calcium palmitate, 10.1\% cholesterol, 0.4\% phosphate, and 3.4\% total calcium. Most of the 26 stones found at the same time as or within several months after cholecystectomy were either cholesterol (69\%) or black pigment (19\%). In contrast, the majority (59\%) of the 22 common duct stones that were diagnosed greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy were brown pigment stones. In conclusion, brown pigment stones are a distinct type of pigment stone characterized by their content of substantial amounts of calcium palmitate. They comprise a significant proportion of common duct stones in this series of United States patients, particularly of those found greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy.},

  abstract = {The initial management of patients with suspected acute biliary infection starts with the measurement of vital signs to assess whether or not the situation is urgent. If the case is judged to be urgent, initial medical treatment should be started immediately including respiratory/circulatory management if required, without waiting for a definitive diagnosis. The patient's medical history is then taken; an abdominal examination is performed; blood tests, urinalysis, and diagnostic imaging are carried out; and a diagnosis is made using the diagnostic criteria for cholangitis/cholecystitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, initial medical treatment should be started immediately, severity should be assessed according to the severity grading criteria for acute cholangitis/cholecystitis, and the patient's general status should be evaluated. For mild acute cholangitis, in most cases initial treatment including antibiotics is sufficient, and most patients do not require biliary drainage. However, biliary drainage should be considered if a patient does not respond to initial treatment. For moderate acute cholangitis, early endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is indicated. If the underlying etiology requires treatment, this should be provided after the patient's general condition has improved; endoscopic sphincterotomy and subsequent choledocholithotomy may be performed together with biliary drainage. For severe acute cholangitis, appropriate respiratory/circulatory management is required. Biliary drainage should be performed as soon as possible after the patient's general condition has been improved by initial treatment and respiratory/circulatory management.

  abstract = {Acute cholangitis is a potentially life-threatening systemic disease resulting from a combination of infection and obstruction of the biliary tree, secondary to different underlying etiologies. Common causes of cholangitis (eg, gallstones, benign and malignant biliary strictures) are well known. However, others (eg, immunoglobulin-G subclass-4–related sclerosing cholangitis) have been described only recently, are still under evaluation, and need to gain broader attention from clinicians. The diagnosis of acute cholangitis is based on clinical presentation and laboratory data indicating systemic infection, as well as diagnostic imaging modalities revealing signs of biliary obstruction and possibly an underlying etiology. The clinical presentation varies, and initial risk stratification is important to guide further management. Early medical therapy, including fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic coverage, is of major importance in all cases, followed by a biliary drainage procedure and, if possible, definitive therapy of the underlying etiology. The type and timing of biliary drainage should be based on the severity of the clinical presentation, and the availability and feasibility of drainage techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and open surgical drainage. ERCP plays a central role in the management of biliary obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis. Endoscopic ultrasound–guided biliary drainage recently emerged as a possible alternative to PTC for second-line therapy if ERCP fails or is not possible.},

  abstract = {The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG‐PS) scale is commonly used by physicians and nurses in oncology, as it correlates with cancer morbidity, mortality, and complications from chemotherapy and can help direct clinical decisions and prognostication. This retrospective cohort study aimed to identify whether ECOG‐PS scores rated by oncologist versus nurses differ in their ability to predict clinical outcomes.Over 19 months, 32 oncologists and 41 chemotherapy nurses from a single academic comprehensive cancer center independently scored ECOG‐PS (range: 0–5) for a random sample of 311 patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Logistic regression models were fit to evaluate the ability of nurse and physician ECOG‐PS scores, as well as the nurse‐physician ECOG‐PS score difference (nurse minus physician), to predict the occurrence of chemotherapy toxicity (CTCAE v4, grade ≥3) and hospitalizations within 1 month from ECOG‐PS ratings, as well as 6‐month mortality or hospice referrals.Physician/nurse ECOG‐PS agreement was 71\% (Cohen's κ = 0.486, p \&lt; .0001). Nurse ECOG‐PS scores had stronger odds ratio for 6‐month mortality or hospice (odds ratio [OR], 3.29, p \&lt; .0001) than physician ECOG‐PS scores (OR, 2.71, p = .001). Furthermore, ECOG‐PS ratings by nurses, but not physicians, correlated with 1‐month chemotherapy toxicity (OR, 1.44, p = .021) and 1‐month hospitalizations (OR, 1.57, p = .041). Nurse‐physician disagreement, but only when physicians gave “healthier” (lower) ratings, was also associated with worse outcomes (chemotherapy toxicity OR = 1.51, p = .045; 1‐month hospitalization OR, 1.86, p = .037; 6‐month mortality or hospice OR, 2.99, p \&lt; .0001).Nurse ECOG‐PS ratings seem more predictive of important outcomes than those of physicians, and physician‐nurse disagreement in ECOG‐PS ratings predicts worse outcomes; scoring by nurses may result in additional clinical benefit.Nurse‐rated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG‐PS) scores, compared with those rated by oncologists, better predicted hospitalizations and severe chemotherapy toxicity within 1 month from ECOG‐PS assessment, as well as mortality or hospice referrals within 6 months. Physician‐nurse disagreement in ECOG‐PS scoring was associated with worse hospitalization, chemotherapy toxicity, and mortality and hospice referral rates. Rating performance statuses of patients with cancer by nurses instead or in addition to oncologists can result in additional clinical benefits, such as improved prognostication, as well as better informed clinical decision making regarding whether or not to administer chemotherapy, the need for additional supportive care, and goals of care discussions.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Low anterior resection syndrome is a highly prevalent condition that can develop after anal sphincter-sparing surgery for rectal cancer and impair quality of life. In this review, we summarize the major features and pathophysiology of this syndrome and discuss treatment approaches. Recent Findings Quality of life correlates significantly with severity of low anterior resection syndrome. Prompt assessment and initiation of therapy are essential to rehabilitating damaged mechanical and neural structures. Anorectal manometry demonstrates a global decrease in sphincteric function postoperatively, though in many patients, function does recover. Transanal irrigation, pelvic floor rehabilitation, and biofeedback are the mainstays of the treatment of major LARS. Definitive stoma can be considered in therapy refractory LARS {$>$}\,2 years. Summary The development of low anterior resection syndrome likely involves an interplay between mechanical and neural pathways. Clinically, patients present at varying levels of severity, and scoring systems are available to help assess patient symptoms and guide therapy. Treatment approaches range from conservative therapies to biofeedback and sacral nerve stimulation. Future randomized controlled trials aimed at risk stratification of patients and development of severity-based treatment algorithms are warranted.},

It can be bilateral and vary in severity. The disease process progresses gradually without affecting daily activities early on, but with time, especially after the fourth or fifth decade, the cataract will eventually mature, making the lens completely opaque to light and interfering with routine activities.[2] Cataracts are~a significant cause of blindness worldwide. Treatment options include correction with refractive glasses only at earlier stages, and if cataracts mature enough to interfere with routine activities, surgery may be advised, which is very fruitful.[3]},

  abstract = {The current clinical criterion standard for measuring abnormal eyeball protrusion is still the historic Hertel exophthalmometer, which is prone to reading errors. Therefore, a smartphone application has been developed to measure exophthalmos.To evaluate a relatively simple noninvasive measurement method for exophthalmos using a smartphone.This cross-sectional study compared smartphone exophthalmometry with the existing reference standard, the Hertel exophthalmometer, or a professional high-resolution 3-dimensional scanner. Participants were patients with exophthalmos due to Graves orbitopathy and other intraorbital conditions and healthy volunteers who were recruited between June 2019 and January 2022 from the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Zurich.All participants were examined twice by 3 different operators using 3 different methods (smartphone, high-resolution scanner, or Hertel exophthalmometer) at an interval of a minimum of 2 weeks or after exophthalmos-changing treatment.Accuracy and precision, test-retest reliability, and interoperator reliability of eyeball protrusion measurements obtained with the smartphone compared to the Hertel exophthalmometer and the high-resolution face scanner.Of 39 participants, 23 patients (median [IQR] age, 54 [44-59] years; 15 [65\%] female and 8 [35\%] male) showed a mean difference in eyeball protrusion of 3.3 mm and 16 healthy volunteers (median [IQR] age, 32 [30-37] years; 11 [69\%] female and 5 [31\%] male) of 0.8 mm without any significant difference between the 3 methods. Accuracy and precision agreement between exophthalmos measures with the smartphone and the Hertel exophthalmometer showed an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.94) and 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.83-0.97) for the high-resolution scanner. Interoperator agreement was highest for the high-resolution scanner (ICC, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.98-0.99]), followed by the smartphone (ICC, 0.95 [95\% CI, 0.92-0.97]) and the Hertel exophthalmometer (ICC, 0.91 [95\% CI, 0.85-0.95]). Test retest reliability was similarly high for the smartphone (ICC, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.82-0.95]), the Hertel exophthalmometer (ICC, 0.92 [95\% CI, 0.83-0.96]), and the high-resolution scanner (ICC, 0.95 [95\% CI, 0.89-0.97]).The findings of this study demonstrate relatively high accuracy and precision, interoperator reliability, and test-retest reliability for smartphone exophthalmometry. These data support the use of a smartphone in place of a Hertel exophthalmometer for measuring exophthalmos in the future.},

  abstract = {The complex anatomy of the orbit generates a complex orbital shape that can only be quantified approximatively by classic linear measurements such as maximum width and height. There is no global three-dimensional quantification of variations in orbital shape. The purpose of this study was to develop a method to quantify a global three-dimensional orbital shape variation in a healthy population and to test a series of explanatory factors. We investigated the hypotheses that orbital shape is related to gender(H1), orbital size(H2) and/or age(H3). Medical computed tomography(CT) images of 60 adult individuals were studied. The study sample consisted of 30 males and 30 females with a mean age of 25.1 years. Four anatomical landmarks and 140 semi-landmarks were measured on both positive and negative 3D reconstructed orbits and analyzed with geometric morphometrics. A principal component analysis(PCA) was computed to define a morphological space. Shape variation was visualized using vector distance maps and diagrams. The greatest variation was seen in the length of the superior orbital fissure. There was a gradient in terms of orbital shape ranging from short, wide orbits to tall, narrow orbits. The analysis did not highlight any significant age-, gender- or size-related impact in terms of orbital shape variation. Future avenues to explore include the study of other potential explanatory factors such as the different embryological origins of the orbital bones, the passage of vessels and nerves, and ethnic origins. This method can also be applied to the study of pathological orbits.},

  abstract = {Thailand is among countries with the highest global incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). While viral hepatitis and liver fluke infections have been associated with HCC and iCCA, respectively, other environmental risk factors, overall risk factor commonality and combinatorial roles, and effects on survival have not been systematically examined. We conducted a TIGER-LC consortium-based population study covering all high-incidence areas of both malignancies across Thailand: 837 HCC, 1474 iCCA, and 1112 controls (2011–2019) were comprehensively queried on lifelong environmental exposures, lifestyle, and medical history. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate risk factors and associated survival patterns. Our models identified shared risk factors between HCC and iCCA, such as viral hepatitis infection, liver fluke infection, and diabetes, including novel and shared associations of agricultural pesticide exposure (OR range of 1.50; 95\% CI: 1.06–2.11 to 2.91; 95\% CI: 1.82–4.63) along with vulnerable sources of drinking water. Most patients had multiple risk factors, magnifying their risk considerably. Patients with lower risk levels had better survival in both HCC (HR 0.78; 95\% CI: 0.64–0.96) and iCCA (HR 0.84; 95\% CI: 0.70–0.99). Risk factor co-exposures and their common associations with HCC and iCCA in Thailand emphasize the importance for future prevention and control measures, especially in its large agricultural sector. The observed mortality patterns suggest ways to stratify patients for anticipated survivorship and develop plans to support medical care of longer-term survivors, including behavioral changes to reduce exposures.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the defining characteristics and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis (NF), emphasizng early diagnostic indications. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE PubMed was searched using the terms necrotizing fasciitis and necrotizing soft tissue infections, paired with early diagnosis. Results were limited to human studies in English. Additional articles were obtained from references within articles. Evidence is levels II and III. MAIN MESSAGE Necrotizing fasciitis is classified according to its microbiology (polymicrobial or monomicrobial), anatomy, and depth of infection. Polymicrobial NF mostly occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Monomicrobial NF is less common and affects healthy individuals who often have a history of trauma (usually minor). Patients with NF can present with symptoms of sepsis, systemic toxicity, or evidence of skin inflammation, with pain that is disproportional to the degree of inflammation. However, these are also present in less serious conditions. Hyperacute cases present with sepsis and quickly progress to multiorgan failure, while subacute cases remain indolent, with festering soft-tissue infection. Because the condition is rare with minimal specific signs, it is often misdiagnosed. If NF is suspected, histology of tissue specimens is necessary. Laboratory and radiologic tests can be useful in deciding which patients require surgical consultation. Once NF is diagnosed, next steps include early wound debridement, excision of nonviable tissue, and wide spectrum cover with intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon disease that results in gross morbidity and mortality if not treated in its early stages. At onset, however, it is difficult to differentiate from other superficial skin conditions such as cellulitis. Family physicians must have a high level of suspicion and low threshold for surgical referral when confronted with cases of pain, fever, and erythema.},

  abstract = {Cardiac murmurs were first described approximately 200 years ago. Subsequently, various clinicians, starting with Samuel Levine, have proposed grading schemes, depicting intensity, or other murmur characteristics, in an attempt to differentiate pathological and physiological murmurs~or different degrees of pathology. In the 1960s, these schemes were adapted by veterinary cardiologists~and have been used over the last 50 years. However, the clinical utility of these schemes has only recently been examined in veterinary medicine (and never examined in humans), and these studies suggest that the current, commonly used murmur grading scheme is unnecessarily complex and contains redundant information. A simpler, more intuitive grading scheme might achieve the same desired outcome as the more complex scheme, potentially with less confusion. This review examines the history of murmur grading~and proposes a reconsideration of the current grading scheme to improve clinical communication.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radioembolization (RE) are frequently used to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who cannot receive curative therapies. Transarterial chemoembolization is a heterogeneous group of procedures; based on two positive clinical trials and three meta-analyses, conventional TACE is the standard of care for patients in the intermediate stage. Transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads has been recently introduced as a more standardized way of performing TACE with similar outcomes and less systemic effects. Radioembolization is a form of brachytherapy in which microspheres are used as a source of internal radiation. Evidence supporting the use of RE derives from consistent, large-cohort series involving patients with more advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, not suitable for TACE or for those who have failed TACE. Transarterial chemoembolization and RE should not be considered competing therapies, but rather complementary tools. The clinical indications for TACE and RE will be further refined as results of ongoing large-scale studies become available.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The mainstay of treatment is cholecystectomy, which is commonly associated with physical pain and may also seriously affect a patient’s quality of life. Clinical research suggests that cholelithiasis is closely related to the age, gender, body mass index, and other basic physical characteristics of patients. Clinical research further suggests that the occurrence of cholelithiasis is related to obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and other diseases. For this reason, we reviewed the following: genetic factors; excessive liver cholesterol secretion (causing cholesterol supersaturation in gallbladder bile); accelerated growth of cholesterol crystals and solid cholesterol crystals; gallbladder motility impairment; and cardiovascular factors. Herein, we summarize and analyze the causes and mechanisms of cholelithiasis, discuss its correlation with the pathogenesis of related diseases, and discuss possible mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Acute pancreatitis is a common indication for hospital admission, increasing in incidence, including in children, pregnancy and the elderly. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis with fluid and/or necrotic collections causes substantial morbidity, and severe disease with persistent organ failure causes significant mortality. The diagnosis requires two of upper abdominal pain, amylase/lipase ≥~3~×upper limit of normal, and/or cross-sectional imaging findings. Gallstones and ethanol predominate while hypertriglyceridaemia and drugs are notable among many causes. Serum triglycerides, full blood count, renal and liver function tests, glucose, calcium, transabdominal ultrasound, and chest imaging are indicated, with abdominal cross-sectional imaging if there is diagnostic uncertainty. Subsequent imaging is undertaken to detect complications, for example, if C-reactive protein exceeds 150 mg/L, or rarer aetiologies. Pancreatic intracellular calcium overload, mitochondrial impairment, and inflammatory responses are critical in pathogenesis, targeted in current treatment trials, which are crucially important as there is no internationally licenced drug to treat acute pancreatitis and prevent complications. Initial priorities are intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and enteral nutrition, and when necessary, critical care and organ support, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, pancreatic exocrine and endocrine replacement therapy; all may have adverse effects. Patients with local complications should be referred to specialist tertiary centres to guide further management, which may include drainage and/or necrosectomy. The impact of acute pancreatitis can be devastating, so prevention or reduction of the risk of recurrence and progression to chronic pancreatitis with an increased risk of pancreas cancer requires proactive management that should be long term for some patients.},

  abstract = {Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the pancreas that may also involve surrounding tissues or remote organs. The Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis was introduced in 1992 and divides patients into mild and severe groups based on clinical and biochemical criteria. Recently, the terminology and classification scheme proposed at the initial Atlanta Symposium have been reviewed and a new consensus statement has been proposed by the Acute Pancreatitis Classification Working Group. Generally, imaging is recommended to confirm the clinical diagnosis, investigate the etiology, and grade the extend and severity of the acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality in most centers for the confirmation of the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and the ruling out of other causes of acute abdomen, but it has limitations in the acute clinical settting. Computed tomography not only establishes the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, but also enables to stage severity of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has earned an ever more important role in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. It is especially useful for imaging of patients with iodine allergies, characterizing collections and assessment of an abnormal or disconnected pancreatic duct. The purpose of this review article is to present an overview of the acute pancreatitis, clarify confusing terminology, underline the role of ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging according to the proper clinical context and compare the advantages and limitations of each modality.},

A retrospective cohort study using data from the SEER program (2007-2015).               Results               . Of the 163,980 patients with CC, 85,779 (52.3\%) presented with right-sided CC (RCC) and 78,201 (47.7\%) with left-sided CC (LCC). Stage distributions were as follows: stage I, 24.1\%; stage II, 27.3\%; stage III, 28.2\%; and stage IV, 20.4\%. In an adjusted modified Poisson regression approach for risk ratio (RR), patients with LCCs were more likely to be male (RR = 1.14; 95\% CI 1.12-1.15, p{$<$}0.001). As compared to stage I, stage II cancers (RR = 0.88, 95\% CI 0.87-0.90, p{$<$}0.001) were less likely to be LCC. Stage IV CC was slightly less likely to be left-sided (RR = 0.98, 95\% CI 0.98, 0.96-1.00, p = 0.028). The median overall survival (OS) for RCC was 87 months. The median OS for LCC was not established, as more than half of the patients diagnosed with LCC were still living at the time of the analysis. In adjusted Cox proportional Hazard model, individuals with stage I, III, and IV LCCs had superior OS as compared to those with matched-stage RCC (adjusted HR = 0.87; 95\% CI 0.85-0.88, p{$<$}0.001). However, OS was worse among those with stage II disease who presented with LCC (adjusted Hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.06; 95\% CI 1.02-1.11, p = 0.004). CC-specific survival (CSS) was superior for LCC versus RCC for stages III and IV but worse for II.               Conclusions               . In this population-cohort study, LCC is associated with superior OS and CSS survival. The overall survival advantage was attributed to stage I, III, and IV disease. Individuals presenting with stage II disease exhibit superior survival if the CC is right-sided.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine and compare epidemiology, patient demographics, and socioeconomic factors of ophthalmic procedures in the United States. Participants All ophthalmic ambulatory procedures performed from 2012 to 2014. Methods The State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD), a collection of data from 29 participating states that represent two-thirds of the U.S. population, were used for analysis. All ophthalmic procedures performed in ambulatory settings from 2012 to 2014 were included. Incidence and demographics for each procedure were assessed, with descriptive statistics determined to highlight key differences in epidemiology and patient characteristics for each procedure. Population-based rates of procedures for each racial group were calculated using national census data. Results Over a period of 3 years, 3 934 004 ophthalmic procedures were performed, with majority being ambulatory (98.5\%). Most common procedures were lens and cataract removal (66.5\%), followed by intraocular procedures (11.4\%) and procedures involving eyelids, cornea, and conjunctiva (8.2\%). All ambulatory procedures had a higher number of female patients except retinal tear and detachment repairs (male patients, 59.4\%). Most procedures had a higher rate in blacks compared with whites and other races, and Medicare was the most common mode of payment. Conclusions Approximately 1.3 million ambulatory ophthalmic procedures were performed every year between 2012 and 2014 in the 29 reporting states of the United States. Low-income groups and certain minorities, apart from blacks, having a lower rate of procedure suggest that disparities exist in provision of eye care. The factors leading to these differences need to be further studied in order to devise strategies to provide equitable care. Résumé Objectif Déterminer et comparer les facteurs épidémiologiques, démographiques et socioéconomiques en lien avec les interventions ophtalmologiques aux États-Unis. Participants Toutes les interventions ophtalmologiques réalisées en ambulatoire entre 2012 et 2014. Méthodes Aux fins de la présente analyse, on a eu recours à la SASD (State Ambulatory Surgery Databases), base de données sur les interventions ambulatoires dans 29 états, soit les deux tiers de la population américaine. Ont ainsi été incluses toutes les interventions ophtalmologiques réalisées en ambulatoire entre 2012 et 2014. L'incidence et les données démographiques liées à chaque intervention ont été évaluées dans l'optique d'extraire des statistiques descriptives de façon à faire ressortir les différences clés quant aux données épidémiologiques et aux caractéristiques des patients pour chacune des interventions. Les taux d'interventions représentatifs de la population pour chacun des groupes raciaux ont été calculés d'après les données de recensement à l’échelle nationale. Résultats Au cours des 3 années de l’étude, 3 934 004 interventions ophtalmologiques ont été réalisées, la majorité d'entre elles en mode ambulatoire (98,5~\%). Les interventions les plus fréquentes portaient sur l'extraction du cristallin et des cataractes (66,5~\%), suivies des interventions intraoculaires (11,4~\%) et des interventions touchant les paupières, la cornée et la conjonctive (8,2~\%). Le nombre de patients de sexe féminin était plus élevé pour toutes les interventions ambulatoires, à l'exception du traitement des déchirures et décollements de la rétine (patients de sexe masculin~: 59,4~\%). Le taux de la plupart des interventions était plus élevé chez les sujets noirs comparativement aux sujets caucasiens ou autres, et Medicare était la forme de paiement le plus souvent utilisée. Conclusions Quelque 1,3 million d'interventions ophtalmologiques ambulatoires ont été réalisées chaque année entre 2012 et 2014 dans les 29 états de la base de données SASD aux États-Unis. On a noté que les sujets à faible revenu et certains groupes minoritaires, outre les noirs, ont eu un taux d'intervention plus faible, ce qui dénote des disparités au chapitre des soins oculaires. Il est important d’étudier les facteurs à l'origine de ces différences si l'on souhaite trouver des stratégies pour offrir des soins équitables.},

  abstract = {Predictors of colorectal cancer have been extensively studied with some evidence suggesting that risk factors vary by subsite. Using data from 2 prospective cohort studies, we examined established risk factors to determine whether they were differentially associated with colon and rectal cancer. Our study population included 87,733 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and 46,632 men from the Health Professionals Follow Up Study (HPFS). Exposure information was collected via biennial questionnaires (dietary variables were collected every 4 years). During the follow-up period (NHS: 1980 to May 31, 2000; HPFS: 1986 to January 31, 2000), we identified 1,139 cases of colon cancer and 339 cases of rectal cancer. We used pooled logistic regression to estimate multivariate relative risks for the 2 outcomes separately and then used polytomous logistic regression to compare these estimates. In the combined cohort, age, gender, family history of colon or rectal cancer, height, body mass index, physical activity, folate, intake of beef, pork or lamb as a main dish, intake of processed meat and alcohol were significantly associated with colon cancer risk. However, only age and sex were associated with rectal cancer. In a stepwise polytomous logistic regression procedure, family history and physical activity were associated with statistically significant different relative risks of colon and rectal cancer. Our findings support previous suggestions that family history and physical activity are not strong contributors to the etiology of rectal cancer. Future investigations of colon or rectal cancer should take into consideration risk factor differences by subsite. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20\% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.},

  abstract = {Aims of this study were to determine the normal range of absolute and relative Hertel exophthalmometric values (EVs) in a Chinese Han population. This population-based cross-sectional study consisted of 2010 healthy Han Chinese (1051 females and 959 males) aged between 8–87 years living in Shenyang, Northeast China, including 515 children (aged 8–14 years), 517 teenagers (aged 15–19 years), 582 adults (aged 20–69 years) and 396 elderly (aged 70–87 years). A Hertel exophthalmometer was used by the same physician for the measurement of EV and inter-orbital distance (IOD). For the entire study population, the Hertel EVs ranged from 10\>mm to 22\>mm; the mean EVs for the left eye (OS) and right eye (OD) were 15.0 ± 1.9\>mm and 15.0 ± 2.0\>mm, respectively; the upper normal limits of the EVs (mean + 2 SD) for OS and OD were 18.8\>mm and 19.0\>mm, respectively; the mean relative EV was 0.20 ± 0.43\>mm. Age, but not sex, had a significant effect on the EV. We concluded that our study provides normative ophthalmic data in a Chinese Han population. The normal EVs, asymmetry and IOD values have been established for clinical reference.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer related death in the world. Biannual surveillance for the disease in patients with cirrhosis and in high risk carriers of hepatitis B virus allows early stage cancer detection and treatment with good long term outcomes. Liver ultrasonography and serum α fetoprotein are the most commonly used surveillance tests. If suspicious results are found on the surveillance test, multiphasic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. If radiologic tests show inconclusive results, liver biopsy or repeat imaging could be considered for confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Management of the disease is complex. Patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, and the selection of treatment should consider factors such as tumor burden, severity of liver dysfunction, medical comorbidities, local expertise, and preference of patients. Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma is best managed by curative treatment, which includes resection, ablation, or transplantation. Patients with intermediate stage disease often receive locoregional treatment. Systemic treatment is reserved for patients with advanced disease. Several positive, phase III, randomized controlled trials have expanded the systemic treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with promising long term outcomes, especially trials using combination treatments, which could also have eventual implications for the treatment of earlier stage disease.},

  abstract = {The Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13) for acute cholangitis and cholecystitis were globally disseminated and various clinical studies about the management of acute cholecystitis were reported by many researchers and clinicians from all over the world. The 1st edition of the Tokyo Guidelines 2007 (TG07) was revised in 2013. According to that revision, the TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis provided better specificity and higher diagnostic accuracy. Thorough our literature search about diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis, new and strong evidence that had been released from 2013 to 2017 was not found with serious and important issues about using TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis. On the other hand, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis has been validated in numerous studies. As a result of these reviews, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis was significantly associated with parameters including 30-day overall mortality, length of hospital stay, conversion rates to open surgery, and medical costs. In terms of severity assessment, breakthrough and intensive literature for revising severity grading was not reported. Consequently, TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading were judged from numerous validation studies as useful indicators in clinical practice and adopted as TG18/TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis without any modification. Free full articles and mobile app of TG18 are available at: http://www.jshbps.jp/modules/en/index.php?content\_id=47. Related clinical questions and references are also included.},
